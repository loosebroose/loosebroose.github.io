I am a geospatial professional that is looking to expand his work and knowledge of all things GIS. I am a dreamer, builder, and problem solver - the things in my life that give me the greatest joys are those that challenge me. When I realized this about myself I decided that continual growth meant continual challenge, it meant embracing things that bring me outside of my comfort zone. 

Prior to my GIS career I ran tree planting crews accross British Columbia. I started planting trees when I was 18, in 2014 - it was a big challenge, it was my hippy dream, most importantly it got me out of my parents house. There was a time in my life where I thought tree planting was the career I would follow for the rest of my life. It taught me so much about myself, the job pushed me to be a leader within my community. It showed me that I was capable, tough, and cool in the face of adversity. When I began running crews I felt proud of what I had accomplished. The job was intense, I often worked 16 hour days, and was racked with anxiety and guilt about my performance. But, at the end of every work day I felt good, I slept well, and I really enjoyed being a leader for the people I worked with. Choosing to follow a different path, and retrain to break into the world of GIS was a difficult decision, but I am so glad I made it. I will always think fondly of my many days spent working hard in the cut blocks, I will always remember sharing beers with friends after the work ended. I hope to soon forget the days spent riding quads in the pouring rain, or the mornings spent sipping crappy coffee from an old thrift shop thermos as mosquitos buzz in my ear.
